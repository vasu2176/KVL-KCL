## Result:  
The voltage results convincingly seem to be in good agreement. The tables clearly
indicate that the calculated and simulated results were found to be the same. Slight deviations
in the experimental results might have been caused by fluctuating values in the
ammeter making it hard to read precise values. In addition, setting the voltmeter to
exactly 10V on the Digital Lab also proved to be a difficult task because the knob was too
sensitive. If this experiment is to be redone, improvements can be made by taking enough
time to set the source voltage on the Digital Lab to the correct value.
